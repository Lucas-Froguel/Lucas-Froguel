## Hello there!

I'm Lucas, a physicist turned into computer nerd. Here are some things about myself:
- :wrench: Iâ€™m currently working as Python Software Engineer for a german company.
- :mage_man: Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master's in Machine Learning Applied to Nuclear Physics at UNESP and a MBA in Data Science at USP. 
- :robot: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool open source projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I guess.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email or LinkedIn.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I seem to be unable to stop studying.
- :space_invader: Hobbies: coffee making, board games, books, programming (yeah), sword fighting.
-  If your first thought here was "General Kenobi", I respect you. 

I have contributed to two open-source projects so far and am looking for more:
- https://github.com/selfire1/BibleGateway-to-Obsidian
- https://github.com/AntiochTechnology/bible-reference-toolkit
